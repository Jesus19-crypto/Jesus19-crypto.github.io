### CPSC 120

* Lab 2 

    One of my favorite labs was Lab 2, as it was the first one I completed in the field of computer science and served as an introduction to what was to come. 

* Lab 3

    One of the reasons why Lab 3 is one of my favorites is because it was one of the first laboratories I completed, giving me a foundation for my future work in computer science.I found this lab to be interesting because it taught me how to edit, compile, and run programs. 

* Lab 12 

    My favorite lab is Lab 12, which I also did as the final assignment for my 120-level course and successfully completed with my team.Working with functions and creating our first animation, which required time and effort, was a positive experience. Also the program was cool with the different gradient colors.
